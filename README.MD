Twitch.tv-App:

This is a basic Twitch.tv App, which fetches streamers details and displays on the screen. Using JSON and AJAX and Bootstrap.
Since Twitch.tv API now requires a API key which is bit complicated so as suggested by @ossia, I hardcoded few streamers details into
a JSON file and fetched the details using AJAX call.
