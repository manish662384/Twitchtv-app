Twitch.tv-App:

This is a basic Twitch.tv App, which fetches streamers details and displays on the screen in a specific format. 
Using JSON and AJAX and Bootstrap. Since Twitch.tv API now requires an API key which is bit complicated process so as suggested by @ossia, 
I hardcoded few streamers details into a JSON file and fetched the details using AJAX call.
